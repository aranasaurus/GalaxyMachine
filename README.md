# GalaxyMachine
Sample app for GalaxyKit

## Setup
The easiest way to get GalaxyMachine up and running is to run `setup.sh`. This will use Carthage to checkout its dependencies (GalaxyKit) as submodules. Then you can open the included Workspace and build/run.

The less easy way will be documented later ðŸ˜¬.
